# What to do, when you got hacked

As many companies have found out (including highly regarded Security company [Fox-IT](https://www.fox-it.com/en/insights/blogs/blog/fox-hit-cyber-attack/)),
getting hacked isn't a question of "if", but rather "when". So its best to just acknowledge the fact that sooner or later, your company will get hacked. 
You can only try to make it as hard and as low-impact as possible.
