# Security Controls / Countermeasures

## Use of defense-in-depth strategy
Secure systems and organizations on several levels, both vertically as horizontally. 
Use a combination of security measures, so if one countermeasure fails, breaks down or is compromised, another is still in place to prevent damage.

## Administrative / Management controls
The rules (often defined by management) by which security should be enforced.: "Paperwork controls": Policies, procedures, security clearances etc. 

## Operational / Physical controls
The physical means to enforce security and access to the organization: Gates, guards, guns, security camera's and monitors.

## Logical / Technical controls
Technical measures to enforce security: Firewalls, encryption, network securities, accounts
