# Defending against WiFi sniffing

* Enable the authentication mechanism: Some routers have no password by default to access the WiFi network. Always enable authentication. 
* Change default passwords: some routers have a standard password or the password is generated based on the model, serial number etc. Always change the default password.
* Change the admin password: routers can be managed using an admin account. Change the admin account's password to something more secure.
* Use strong WEP or WPA-PSK keys.
* Firewall: Firewall software can also reduce unauthorized access
