# Secure design

Concepts:

## Defence in depth
Build multiple layers of security, to ensure security will not fail with the first layer of defence

* [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defense_in_depth_%28computing%29)

## Minimize attack surface

Remove unused code, code comments, API's, VM's, libraries and otyher resources

* [OWASP Attack Surface cheat sheet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attack_surface)
* [3 ways to minimize attack surface](https://www.techrepublic.com/article/3-ways-to-minimize-cyberattack-threats-by-reducing-attack-surfaces/)

## Least Privilege


## Fail safe or Fail closed


## Use existing security controls


## Don't hardcode


## Careful comments


## Re-authentication for important transactions


## Authorization using framework


## Segregation of data (DTAP)


## Threat Modelling


## Protection of Source-code


## Error Handling


## Logging and alerting: useful data, but no sensitive data


## Categorize data based on sensitivity
