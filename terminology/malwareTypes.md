# Malware types
Group name of malicious software often installed without the knowledge and explicit consent of the user.

## Adware
Malware that shows the user advertisements. This type of malware can sometimes be installed along with (often) free or unpaid software the user has personally installed.

## Ransomware
Malware that encrypts data or system-files on the targeted system and tries to extort the user (often in crypto-currency) to regain or decrypt those files. 
Regaining access is not guaranteed. This type of malware can only exist due to victims that actually pay the decryption fees. General advice therefore is to never pay. 
Unfortunately there are numerous examples or large orgnanizations (Hospitals, Police etc.) that actually paid the extortion fees. 

## Rootkit
Low level malicious software that interferes with the regular functionality of the operating system. Can be used to hide software and tools running, 
so these cannot be detected. Guarding against rootkits is very complex, but possible with things like timing detection. In such methods, a system would indirectly 
detect inconsistencies using comparisons of internal and external timings.

### Bootkit
Rootkit that executes on boot, starting before the OS boots up.

## Dialer
Old malware that used Dail-up connections to dial pay-per-use numbers and collect currency from users via phone-bills
This type of malware could re-emerge in Trojan smartphone apps

## Botnet


## Spyware
Malware that spies on the target, often remaining as invisible to the target as possible. 
Helps the hacker to either gain:
* extra information to enable more advanced hacks
* credentials to use for stealing currency via internet-banking
* creditcard information
* compromising material to blackmail a victim.

Compromising material could be x-rated video or photo material, sometimes gained via secretive activated webcams

### Key-logger
A keylogger is a typical example of spyware to gain login-credentials of a victim.<br>
Hardware keyloggers also exist which can be installed in between the victims device and (cabled) keyboard. 

## Trojan
Malware disguised as legitimate software so that the user installs it manually. Often used to remotely control (aspects of) the target's system.
Also see Spyware.

Other malicious activities a Trojan can do:
* Use the infected system in botnets for DDoS attacks, crypto-mining etc.
* Steal sensitive data or login-credentials (spyware) or bank-money
* Modify or damage the system's applications and files

Types of Trojan (based on activity):
* Backdoor, which the attacker can connect to (or vice versa) to make the victim's device perform specific tasks
* Botnet, which the attacker can instruct to DDoS other targets or send large amounts of spam-mail
* (Crypto)miners, which use the infected device to mine cryptocoins

## Virus / Worm
Malicious software often used to either destroy a system or data or make it unavailable for normal use. 
A virus often copies or spreads itself automatically through computer networks or devices like USB-sticks, cd-roms, DVD's etc.
The difference between virus or wurm could be made as such: virusses replicate through attaching to applications or files. Wurms replicate through networks.
