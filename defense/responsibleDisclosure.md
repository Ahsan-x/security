# Responsible disclosure

Security testing can be an expensive thing. Also, if your product, service or company requires a certain level of security (and most if not all, do)
you have to maintain a decent level of security at any one time. Obviously, threats your security may face, change over time while these get more advanced 
or tactics simply change. This requires regular check-ups and an ongoing effort to keep both procedures and security measures at an acceptable level for your business. 

Lucky for you, there are numerous people all over the world that can help you. They are, the ethical hackers. 

## Disclosure terms
Make sure you have clear and easily accessible procedures in place for hackers to follow. You would want a hacker to disclose information as easily as possible.
You don't want to have hackers search your website for hours just to find a mail-address to send his findings to.

## Security.txt
Use this proposed standard on your company website to enclose disclosure contact details and procedures.
This standard makes it easy to find for ethical hackers and as more and more companies use this standard, it will be the first thing a hacker may look.

## Embrace hackers
Make sure hackers have an incentive to follow a responsible disclosure procedure. Make them feel welcomed and appreciated. You don't have to dish out large bounties
(although it certainly helps ;-)), a geeky shirt may actually do wonders. Don't scare them off by too much regulations and limitations, as these people may often be 
aversive to authority. A good thing to do is have a technical security employee be their central contact.
