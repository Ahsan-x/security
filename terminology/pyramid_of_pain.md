# Pyramid of Pain

The concept of the Pyramid of Pain was invented by [David J. Bianco](https://twitter.com/davidjbianco) in response to reporting of different Security organizations on the APT1 group identified as Comment Crew or PLA Unit 61398.
The Pyramid of Pain describes different levels of indicators to detect a specific threat actor and the ability to respond to those indicators.
The concept promotes to prioritize acting on the higher-level indicators (towards the top of the pyramid), which makes it more challenging for the threat actor to evade an organization's defenses, thus causing more pain.
