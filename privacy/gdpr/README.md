# GDPR

## In a nutshell

Ask these questions about data in your "business":
* What do we have?
* Why do we have it?
* How long do we need it?
* To which individual does it relate?

Can you answer these questions?

## Fines

The maximum fines for not adhering to GDPR are one of these, whichever is highest:
* â‚¬ 20 Million
* 4% of global annual turnover

The actual fines are based on several factors:
* What data has leaked:
  * What type of data was leaked?
  * How sensitive is the data?
  * What is the impact of leaking this data?
  * How large was the data-set leaked (both absolute and relative to the size of the data held by the breached entity)?
  * How long was the data available by unaothorized entities?
* How did the breached entity protect the data?
  * Was the breach intentional?
  * Did the breached entity take security measures to prevent a breach?
  * If not, was the lack of security measures intentional?
* How did the breached entity handle the breach?
  * Did it stop the leaks as soon as possible?
  * Did it inform affected users?
  * Did it provide sufficient, correct and transparent information about the breach?
  * Did it inform privacy authorities?
  * Did it cooperate with authorities?
