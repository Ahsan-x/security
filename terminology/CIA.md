## Confidentiality
Sometimes information is confidential and should only be accessible to a single or limited group of people.
To enforce this, encryption is used. With properly implemented encryption, data is encoded in a non-readable format. 
only entities with the decryption keys can make the data readable again. So the data may still be accessible to anyone,
but can only be made readable using the decryption keys.
