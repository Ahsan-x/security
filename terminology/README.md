# Terminology

| Term | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| Adware | See [Malware types](malwareTypes.md) |
| APT  | Advanced Persistent Threat, followed by a number of identification. A state, state-sponsored or other highly advanced hacker / organization. When more information is identified, these often get nick-names. See [Hacker groups](hackerGroups.md) |
| Attack surface | Number of attack vectors or potential access points a hacker may explore to try to hack. Compare this with a building with numerous doors and windows. Each door, window etc. gives an attacker another way to gain access to the building, thereby increasing the "attack-surface". |
| Attack vector | Potential access points to target in a hack |
| Blue Team | Defense side of an ethical hack operation. Also see Red team / Blue team testing |
| DoS | Denial of Service, flooding a system with more requests it can handle, thereby making the system unable to respond to valid requests. |
| DDoS | Distributed Denial of Service |
| Exploit | Method or technique to apply onto a vulnerability to execute a hack |
| Firewall |  |
| Fishing |  |
| Footprinting | Information gathering. Also see [Stages of a hack](../techniques/stages.md) |
| FUD | Fear uncertainty and doubt |
| FUD | Fully undetectable, either undetectable by tools like Antivirus or Firewalls or not labeled as malicious tools |
| Hacker | Also see [Types of hackers](hackerTypes.md) |
| Hacking | Having a system do something it was not designed to do. (note: the absense of the work computer. The system can be any system, even a non-fysical system like a business process, a legal system, tax-system etc. ) |
| Key Logger | Software on a system that records all key-strokes. Mostly running without the knowledge of the current user of the system and used to gather login-credentials or other valuable information |
| Malware | Malicious software  |
| Proxy | Less reliable than VPN. Chaining proxies can make it much harder to detect. |
| Ransomware | Also see Malware |
| RAT | Remote Administration Tools |
| Red Team | Attack side of an ethical hack operation |
| Red team / Blue team testing | Testing security by pitting one group of hackers as the attackers (Red team) against the other team of defenders (Blue team) engaging in a real life security "war", often in a safe virtualized environment to simulate real-world attacks |
| Reverse-shell | Malicious software on a system to gain access to that system initiated from the system iteself to the hacker |
| Root kit | See [Malware types](malwareTypes.md) |
| Social Engineering | Ways of using weakness of people (helpfulness) by persuading them to give up information that can help you in gaining access gaining access to a system, organization or building ||
| SQL Injection |  |
| Target | System or organization which will be attacked by the hacker |
| Target value | Value in either money, criticality, aid to reputation etc. of a specific target |
| Terminal | Command interface of an OS to directly access certain tools using typed commands |
| Tor | Client-software to anonimize internet traffic. Downsides: Good, but no 100% guarentee. Can often result in slow connection. |
| Virus | See [Malware types](malwareTypes.md) |
| VPN | Virtual Private Network, used to anonymize traffic. Traffic via VPN's is encrypted. When using a "bullet-proof" VPN provider (one that prioritizes privacy and anonimity) requests from authorities mostly cannot and / or will not be effective to gain information about you or your activities. |
| VPS | Virtual Private Service. Way to encapsulate and / or isolate services that should only be accessed by certain systems. Example: a webserver may contain a VPS SQL-server that only the web-server should be able to access. By setting up a VPS for the SQL-server the actual webserver will not expose the SQL connection points to the outside world, thereby enlarging the attack-surface of the system. |
| Vulnerability | Weakness in a system, orgnanization, software etc. that could be exploited  |
| Zero Day | Exploit for which no patch, mitigation is available |
