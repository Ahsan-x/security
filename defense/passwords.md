# Defending against password-cracking

Password cracking can very effectively be defended against using (a combination of) the following techniques

Users can adopt:
* Unique passwords
* Long passwords
* Complex passwords
* Password-managers

Developers can adopt:
* Proper hashing
* Proper encryption (using hardened algorithms)
* Dynamic & static salting
* 2FA / Multi-FA
* Account lockout (temporary, after failed logins)
