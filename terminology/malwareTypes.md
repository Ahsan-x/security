# Malware types
Group name of malicious software often installed without the knowledge and explicit consent of the user.

## Adware
Malware that shows the user advertisements. This type of malware can sometimes be installed along with (often) free or unpaid software the user has personally installed.

## Ransomware
Malware that encrypts data or system-files on the targeted system and tries to extort the user (often in crypto-currency) to regain or decrypt those files. Regaining access is not guaranteed. 
This type of malware can only exist due to victims that actually pay the decryption fees. General advice therefore is to never pay. Unfortunately there are numerous examples or large orgnanizations (Hospitals, Police etc.) that actually paid the extortion fees. 

## Rootkit
Low level malicious software that interferes with the regular functionality of the operating system. Can be used to hide software and tools running, so these cannot be detected. Guarding against rootkits is very complex, but possible with things like timing detection. In such methods, a system would indirectly detect inconsistencies using comparisons of internal and external timings.

## Spyware
Malware that spies on the target, often remaining as much invisible to the target as possible. 
Helps the hacker to either gain extra information to enable more advanced hacks or gain compromising material to blackmail a victim.<br>
A keylogger is a typical example of spyware to gain login-credentials of a victim.<br>
Compromising material could be x-rated video or photo material, sometimes gained via infected webcams

## Trojan
Malware disguised as legitimate software so that the user installs it manually. 

## Virus / Worm
Malicious software often used to either destroy a system or data or make it unavailable for normal use. A virus often copies or spreads itself automatically through computer networks or devices like USB-sticks, cd-roms, DVD's etc.
