# Defending against footprinting

Footprinting cannot be eliminated, but can be minimized.


## Review
* Review all information published on websites, email social media to ensure it does not contain sensitive information
* Train and educate employees on footprinting and avoiding leaking sensitive information

## Important information to filter

* Personnel names and information (complex because of LinkedIn)
* Phone numbers and addresses
* Architecture and equipment upgrades
* Software, OS-es and tools used (make sure you review vacancies for this, which is dillema. Keep required skills generic instead of specific)
* Organizational changes (again: LinkedIn)
* Internal and sensitive information

Ways to do this:
* Limit access to competitive intelligence
* Require NDAs
* Periodic self-footprinting
* Suspicious for inquisitive persons (might be a hacker)
* Review waste and trash (use shredders and secured waste disposal, also review this process)
* Train and educate employees regularly (including teaching why)
