This Stack-overflow [thread](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/184618/what-is-the-best-comment-in-source-code-you-have-ever-encountered) lists the best (worst?) funniest code-comments encountered.

Some examples:

```

* the valiant knights of programming who toil away, without rest,
* fixing our most awful code. To you, true saviors, kings of men,
* I say this: never gonna give you up, never gonna let you down,
* never gonna run around and desert you. Never gonna make you cry,
* never gonna say goodbye. Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you.

// Once you are done trying to 'optimize' this routine,
// and have realized what a terrible mistake that was,
// please increment the following counter as a warning
// to the next guy:

// total_hours_wasted_here = 42
// 
```

```
Exception up = new Exception("Something is really wrong.");
throw up;  //ha ha

//Now, God only knows
