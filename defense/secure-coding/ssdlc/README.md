## Agile software development

Modern & Secure development: a mismatch ?

| Agile Dev.            | Security              |
|-----------------------|-----------------------|
| Speed & Flexibility   | Stable & Rigorous     |  
| Short cycles          | Extra activities      |
| Limited documentation | Extensive analysis    |
| Functionality-driven  | Non-functional        |


## Secure Agile Manifesto

1. Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.
2. Working valuable software is the primary measure of progress.
3. Security is a shared responsibility between everybody involved in the life cycle of the product.
4. Welcome changing (security) requirements, even late in development, taking into account that enough security is enough.
5. Dare to deploy software. Not every release requires full assurance.
6. Provide security elements to use in development projects. These elements should be known, readily available and continuously evolving.
7. Security should be automated and incorporated in the development practices.
8. Build projects around motivated individuals. Knowing how to build secure software is an intrinsic motivator.
9. The most effective solution emerges from self-organizing teams able to call upon security experts when needed.
10. At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, adjusting its processes and technical solutions accordingly.
